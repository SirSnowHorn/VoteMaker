# VoteMaker

VoteMaker is a political database that informs voters of elections they are eligible to vote in, which politicians share their views, those politicians voting record and history, and also helps eligible voters registers.

Many eligible voters are either not registered or do not understand how to register to vote, receive absentee ballots, or how the process itself works. Even if a citizen can vote, they might not understand the differences between politicians and how to find the ones that represent their views.
